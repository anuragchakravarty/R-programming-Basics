# Analyzing Vegetable Sales Data Using R: Data Frame Operations & Statistical Insights
This is a basic R-programming code that creates a data frame containing information about vegetables, countries, units sold, and price per unit.
In this, I have performed basic data frame techniques like 
1. Creating vectors and combining them into a data frame
2. Finding Minimum and maximum values & Sum and average
3. Printing top and bottom rows as per requirement
4.  Calculation dimension and so on.

Just go through my work...
