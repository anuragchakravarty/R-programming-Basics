# R-programming-Basics
This is a basic R-programming code that creates a data frame containing information about vegetables, countries, units sold, and price per unit.
In this, I have performed basic data frame techniques like 
(1) Creating vectors and combining them to data frame
(2) Finding Minimum and maximum values & Sum and average
(3) Printing top and bottom rows as per requirement
(4) Calculation dimension and so on.

Just go through my work...
